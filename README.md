# JSL02 Project: Task Input and Status Validation System For the Kanban website 

---

## What is Task Input and Status Validation? :
- This is a system built with JavaScript that allows users to input task information. The program then validates the status entered and provides feedback using prompts, alerts, and console logs. This enhances the Kanban website by introducing an interactive task input menu, currently implemented through browser pop-ups (prompt and alert).


---

## Key Features:

- Enter a Task Title, Description, and Status via prompts.
- Accepts only valid statuses: "TODO", "DOING", or "DONE".
- Automatically corrects letter casing.
- Alerts users when the status entered is invalid.
- Tasks with "DONE" status are logged to the console.
- Tasks with "TODO" or "DOING" trigger a motivational message in the console.
